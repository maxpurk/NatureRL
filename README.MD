# NatureRL: Reinforcement Learning Projects with OpenAI Gymnasium

## Overview
NatureRL is a collection of reinforcement learning projects, showcasing hands-on experience with OpenAI Gymnasium environments. This repository includes various experiments and implementations in environments like CarRacing, CartPole, Breakout, and a CustomProject.

Each sub-directory contains training scripts, saved models, and log data for different reinforcement learning algorithms and approaches.


## Environments and Algorithms

- **CarRacing:** Implementations with various Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) versions.
- **CartPole:** Experiments with PPO and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms.
- **Breakout:** Advanced Actor-Critic (A2C) methods applied to the Breakout environment.
- **CustomProject:** A platform for experimenting with custom reinforcement learning algorithms and environments.

## Getting Started
